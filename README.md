This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates a common off-by-one error in array iteration. The program attempts to calculate the sum of elements in an array, but the for loop's condition `i <= arr.length` causes an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` because the valid indices range from 0 to `arr.length - 1`.  The solution demonstrates how to correctly iterate through the array using the condition `i < arr.length`.
